</div>

#### Key Features:

- Real-Time Data Capture: Captures streaming data from various sources and makes it available for processing in real-time.
- Scalability: Automatically scales to match the throughput of your data, handling gigabytes of data per second from hundreds of thousands of sources.
- Data Retention: Allows you to configure the retention period for your data streams to retain data for several days.
- Integration with AWS Services: Seamlessly integrates with AWS services like AWS Lambda, Amazon Elasticsearch Service, and Amazon S3.

#### Use in Project:
`Amazon Kinesis` is used to capture and stream real-time data from various sources within MadHatter Corp. This includes user interactions, transaction logs, and IoT devices. `Kinesis` ensures that data is ingested as it arrives, enabling immediate processing and analysis.

### AWS Lambda

`AWS Lambda` is a serverless compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. `Lambda`automatically runs your code in response to events, such as changes to data in an Amazon S3 bucket or updates to a DynamoDB table.

    <img src="assets/Lambda.png" alt="AWS Lambda" width="200" height="200">
</div>

#### Key Features:

- Event-Driven Execution: Runs code in response to triggers such as HTTP requests, changes in data, or system events.
- Automatic Scaling: Automatically scales the execution of your code based on the size of the workload.
- Pay-as-You-Go: Charges only for the compute time you consume, making it cost-effective.
- Integrated Security: Provides fine-grained control over access to resources using AWS IAM.


#### Use in Project:
`AWS Lambda` is used to process data in real-time as it is captured by Amazon Kinesis. `Lambda functions` are triggered by the streaming data, allowing for immediate processing, transformation, and forwarding of data to other services for indexing and analysis.

### Amazon Elasticsearch Service

`Amazon Elasticsearch` Service (Amazon ES) is a fully managed service that makes it easy to deploy, secure, and operate Elasticsearch at scale with zero downtime. It allows you to perform interactive log analytics, real-time application monitoring, and more.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="assets/ElasticSearch.png" alt="Amazon ElasticSearch" width="200" height="200">
</div>

#### Key Features:

- Real-Time Indexing: Provides real-time indexing and querying of data.
- Scalability: Scales to handle petabytes of data and thousands of concurrent queries.
- Advanced Search Capabilities: Offers powerful search, analytics, and visualization capabilities using Kibana.
- Integrated Security: Provides built-in security features such as VPC support, AWS IAM integration, and encryption.

#### Use in Project:
`Amazon Elasticsearch` Service is used to index and search the processed data. The real-time indexing capabilities of Elasticsearch allow MadHatter Corp. to perform fast and efficient searches and analytics on the data, providing valuable insights for fraud detection, recommendation engines, and operational monitoring.

### Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)

`Amazon Simple Notification Service` (SNS) is a fully managed messaging service for both application-to-application (A2A) and application-to-person (A2P) communication. It enables the publishing of messages from an application and delivering them to other applications or end-users.

<div style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="assets/SNS.png" alt="Amazon SNS" width="200" height="200">
</div>

#### Key Features:

- Real-Time Notifications: Sends notifications to various endpoints such as email, SMS, and HTTP/S endpoints in real-time.
- Scalability: Automatically scales to handle high throughput.
- Flexible Message Delivery: Supports multiple message delivery formats and protocols.
- Integrated Security: Provides secure messaging with encryption and IAM policies.

#### Use in Project:
`Amazon SNS` is used to send real-time notifications based on specific events detected during data processing. For example, if a potential fraud is detected, SNS sends immediate alerts to the relevant stakeholders, enabling them to take swift action.

### Amazon QuickSight

`Amazon QuickSight` is a scalable, serverless, embeddable, machine learning-powered business intelligence (BI) service built for the cloud. It lets you easily create and publish interactive dashboards that include machine learning insights.
